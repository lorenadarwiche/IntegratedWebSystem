# Integrated Web System
## Project Overview
The Integrated Web System is a comprehensive project built using MySQL, PHP, CSS, and HTML. Designed to streamline various web functions, this system offers a seamless user experience.

## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. I reviewed websites like [PHP Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/php), [PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor](www.php.net),[HTML Tutorial](www.w3schools.com/html), 
[SQL Tutorial](www.w3schools.com/sql), to help me with understanding the basics of each line of code.
2. After reviewing these website, I searched up some [Youtube](https://youtu.be/scd8YKiuS7I?si=jP-5ELILV12qaYB2) videos that helped with trying to understand the logic behind the code and how to set it up! However, I didn't do everything that was said in the video as I did wanna try to do my own twist/way of doing the website!
